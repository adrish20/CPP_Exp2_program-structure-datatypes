<p>In C++, variables store data and must be declared with a specific datatype. Common datatypes include `int` for integers, `float` and `double` for floating-point numbers, `char` for characters, and `bool` for boolean values. Declaring a variable involves specifying its type followed by its name, such as `int age;` or `double salary;`. Variables can store and manipulate data throughout the program.</p>
